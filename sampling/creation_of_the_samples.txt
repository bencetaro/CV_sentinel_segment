Creation of training/validation samples:


I. Training images
I created 201x201 pixel rectangles on Sentinel 2 TCI images for the samples. In this format:

- images output: .jpg, uint8, RGB

II. Training labels
Long process, so in general I made NDVI (good for masking out artifictial, and water areas) and 
NDWI (does what ndvi plus road segments can be masked out) rasters and binary classified them (threshold 0.33 and 0.35). 
Then made some geoprocess, and classification in the end to create the labels.

- labels output: .png, uint8, 1 chanel: 1-forest 2-bg
