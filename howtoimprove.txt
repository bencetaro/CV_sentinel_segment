Possible improvements could be:

1. One of the problems is, that the samples are coming from Serbia, Czechia, Romania, and the target (test) area was Hungary.
   Another one is that the images were taken in different time, with different instrument from Sentinel.
--> All these together causes that only bigger extents of forests are classified correctly, and smaller bunch of pixels or even distinct pixels (often found inside cities) are not.
--> So it could be solved by taking extra samples from the same images that will be classified later.

2. Training the model on GPU, and additional transformations, hyperparameter tuning etc. could also improve the results.

3. Maybe better results could be achieved by using NDVI as training samples
